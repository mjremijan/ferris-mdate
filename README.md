You can pin a CMD batch file to Start Menu or Taskbar by the following procedure:

Right-mouse click on CMD script, and select create shortcut. This creates a shortcut in the same folder. Go to the newly created shortcut and Right-mouse click on the file, and select Properties from the list. In the Properties window, under Target, add `cmd.exe /K` to the target field. Once you've done that, the shortcut icon changes from a cmd icon to an DOS prompt icon. Now you can pin this shortcut to either the Start Menu or the Taskbar, as required.
